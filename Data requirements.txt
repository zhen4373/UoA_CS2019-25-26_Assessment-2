Data requirements (refined) :
    The flying club employs 8 instructors. Instructors conduct training flights, and each training flight is taught by exactly one instructor.
    A pleasure flight can carry up to 3 passengers. Training flights do not carry any passengers at all.
    The club offers four pleasure flight options, each with a different duration: 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 2 hours and half-day. Each scheduled pleasure flight must be an instance of one of these options.
    Every pleasure flight is operated by exactly two pilots.
    A pilot may be assigned to a maximum of two flights per calendar day.
    If a pilot undertakes two flights in one day, the flights must occur in different time slots. We assume the day is divided into two booking sessions: morning and afternoon.
    There are three pilot roles in the club: Captain, Chief Officer, and Officer.
    If a flight includes one or more Officers, at least one of the two assigned pilots must be a Captain. Officers cannot fly without a supervising Captain.
    An Officer may undertake a maximum of one flight per day, regardless of flight type (pleasure or training).
    For each passenger, the system records personal details including full name, age, gender and phone number. Passenger data is collected when booking a pleasure flight.
    Passengers travel as part of a party. A party consists of one or more passengers and is responsible for a single pleasure flight booking.
    Passengers under 18 must be accompanied by at least one adult within the same party on the same flight.
    Each party must designate exactly one passenger within the party as the point of contact for cancellations or schedule changes. This is stored as a reference to a specific passenger in the Party record.
    For every scheduled flight, the system records the flight date, start time, duration, route and flight type.
    The system must record which pilots are assigned to each flight through a pilot–flight assignment structure. Each flight has exactly two pilots.
    For pleasure flights, the system stores all passengers travelling as part of the booking party. Training flights do not carry passengers.

Transaction requirements (I don’t think we need to change anything here):

    List all the pilots on a given pleasure flight 
    List all the pleasure flights a given pilot undertakes
